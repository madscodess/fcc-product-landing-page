Build a Product Landing Page

Objective: Build a page that is functionally similar to this: https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks/

Source of the project can be found in freeCodeCamp curriculum.

Requirements:

Page should include:
Navigation buttons that take user to the corresponding section of the landing page
Product video
A form element with required email input and submit button
Navigation bar should always be at the top of the viewport
Include at least one media query
Should utilise CSS flexbox at least once


üìù The project was started in the freecodecamp's coding environment with the items in list above completed and no css other than very minimal flexbox used. 

I moved it across to vs code and made some improvements:
- Various images added from unsplash
- Shadows and borders used to make picture's look less flat.
- normalize CSS looked into and added
- Responsiveness - desktop, tablet and mobile
- Create several links to act as buttons, this is because a button as a link is bad practice :
